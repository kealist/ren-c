; Ren-C's COMPOSE has many more features than historical Rebol.  These features
; range from having two types of slots: (single) and ((spliced)), to being
; able to put sigils or quotes on the spliced material.

; Splicing vs. non
;
([[a b] * a b] = compose [([a b]) * (([a b]))])

; Preserve one element rule vs. tolerate vaporization.  ~null~ isotopes are
; treated the same by the compose site as pure NULL.
;
([~null~ *] = compose [(null) * ((null))])
([~null~ *] = compose [(~null~) * ((~null~))])

; Comments vaporize regardless of form.

([*] = compose [(comment "single") * ((comment "spliced"))])

; Only true invisibility will act as invisible in the single case, but in the
; spliced case the invisible isotopic intent is tolerated vs. an error.
;

; BLANK!s are as-is in the single form, but vanish in the spliced form, and
; other rules are just generally the append rules for the type.  Evaluative
; types can't be spliced.
