; CALL is a native built by the C code, BROWSE depends on using that, as well
; as some potentially OS-specific detection on how to launch URLs (e.g. looks
; at registry keys on Windows)

    "Open web browser to a URL or local file."

    ; Note that GET-OS-BROWSERS uses the Windows registry convention of having
    ; %1 be what needs to be substituted.  This may not be ideal, it was just
    ; easy to do rather than have to add processing on the C side.  Review.
