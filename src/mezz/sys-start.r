    Note: {
        The Startup_Core() function in %b-init.c is supposed to be a fairly
        minimal startup, to get the system running.  For instance, it does
        not do any command-line processing...as the host program might not
        even *have* a command line.  It just gets basic things set up like
        the garbage collector and other interpreter services.

        Not much of that work can be delegated to Rebol routines, because
        the evaluator can't run for a lot of that setup time.  But at the
        end of Startup_Core() when the evaluator is ready, it runs this
        routine for any core initialization code which can reasonably be
        delegated to Rebol.

        After this point, it is expected that further initialization be done
        by the host.  That includes the mentioned command-line processing,
        which due to this layering can be done with PARSE.
